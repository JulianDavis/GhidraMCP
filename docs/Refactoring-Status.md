# GhidraMCP Refactoring Status Dashboard

## Overview

This document serves as the single source of truth for tracking the GhidraMCP plugin refactoring progress. It provides a comprehensive view of the project's current status, completed work, and next steps.
This is strictly a code organization refactoring effort. The goal is to restructure the existing codebase to follow better architectural patterns without adding new features or changing current functionality.
We are preserving as much of the existing code as possible while moving it into a more maintainable structure.

## Critical Path Items

These items require immediate attention to align with the reference architecture:

1. **Consolidate EmulatorService in Target Location** (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
   - Reference architecture location: `com.juliandavis.ghidramcp.emulation.core`
   - Move functionality from `services.emulator` implementation to the core implementation
   - Refactor any dependent components to use the core implementation
   - Remove duplicate implementation after migration is complete
