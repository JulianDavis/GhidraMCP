# GhidraMCP Refactoring Status Dashboard

## Overview

This document serves as the single source of truth for tracking the GhidraMCP plugin refactoring progress. It provides a comprehensive view of the project's current status, completed work, and next steps.
This is strictly a code organization refactoring effort. The goal is to restructure the existing codebase to follow better architectural patterns without adding new features or changing current functionality.
We are preserving as much of the existing code as possible while moving it into a more maintainable structure.

## Critical Path Items

These items require immediate attention to align with the reference architecture:

1. ~~**Consolidate EmulatorService in Target Location** (CRITICAL PRIORITY)~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - ~~Reference architecture location: `com.juliandavis.ghidramcp.emulation.core`~~
   - ~~Move functionality from `services.emulator` implementation to the core implementation~~
   - ~~Refactor any dependent components to use the core implementation~~
   - ~~Remove duplicate implementation after migration is complete~~

2. ~~**Fix EmulatorOperations and Move to Correct Package** (CRITICAL PRIORITY)~~ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
   - ~~Reference architecture location: `com.juliandavis.ghidramcp.emulation.core`~~
   - ~~Fix internal method duplication issues~~
   - ~~Implement missing functionality required by HTTP handlers~~
   - ~~Establish proper integration pattern with other components~~

3. **Remove Redundant HTTP Handlers** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Remove EmulatorHttpHandler implementations from the services package
   - After testing confirms the api.handlers implementation works correctly
   - Update any references to use the new canonical implementation

4. **Align Component Locations with Reference Architecture** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Move all utility classes to their designated locations
   - Ensure session management follows reference architecture
   - Normalize package structure to match reference hierarchy

5. **Complete Service Registry Integration** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Ensure all services register through ServiceRegistry
   - Configure service dependencies as defined in reference architecture
   - Implement proper lifecycle management

## Next Steps

1. **Clean Up Deprecated Service Implementations** üîÑ IN PROGRESS
   - ‚úÖ EmulatorOperations class moved to correct location
   - Remove remaining deprecated implementations in services.emulator package 
   - Ensure all references use the canonical implementations
   - Update any remaining references to use the new locations

2. **Restructure HTTP Handlers According to Reference**
   - Complete migration of all handler implementations to `api.handlers` package
   - Ensure consistent extension of BaseHttpHandler
   - Update endpoint registrations to use the canonical handlers

3. **Refactor Package Structure to Match Reference**
   - ‚úÖ EmulatorOperations completed and moved to correct location
   - Normalize utility classes into their designated packages
   - Align session management with reference design

4. **Begin Phase 4: Additional Service Migration**
   - Start migrating MemoryCrossReferenceService
   - Start migrating MemoryPatternSearchService
   - Follow the same pattern established with EmulatorService

5. **Update Documentation to Reflect Architecture Progress**
   - Maintain alignment metrics as components are refactored
   - Document architectural decisions for future reference
   - Ensure technical debt is not accumulated during migration
