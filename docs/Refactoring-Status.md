# GhidraMCP Refactoring Status Dashboard

This document serves as the single source of truth for tracking the GhidraMCP plugin refactoring progress. It provides a comprehensive view of the project's current status, completed work, and next steps.

## Overview

**Current Status**: Implementation Phase 3 - Emulator Migration

The refactoring project has progressed from planning to implementation. We have:
- Created the package structure
- Implemented core base classes
- Completed DataTypeService migration (Phase 2)
- Made significant progress on EmulatorService migration (Phase 3)

> **IMPORTANT**: This is strictly a code organization refactoring effort. The goal is to restructure the existing codebase to follow better architectural patterns without adding new features or changing current functionality. We are preserving as much of the existing code as possible while moving it into a more maintainable structure.

## Critical Path Items

These items require immediate attention to maintain the refactoring schedule:

1. **Fix Code Quality Issues in EmulatorOperations** (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
   - Fix internal method duplication where identical methods are repeated multiple times
   - Implement missing functionality required by HTTP handlers
   - Establish a proper integration pattern with other components

2. **Resolve Code Duplication Across Packages** (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
   - EmulatorSession exists in two different packages with separate implementations
   - EmulatorHttpHandler exists in two different packages with overlapping functionality
   - StackTracker and BreakpointEvaluator exist in both util and operations packages
   - Consolidate duplicate implementations into single, canonical locations

3. **Resolve EmulatorService Implementation Location** (CRITICAL PRIORITY)
   - Decide on final package structure (emulation.core vs services.emulator)
   - Consolidate duplicate implementations
   - Maintain complete functionality during transition

4. **Finalize HTTP Handler Refactoring** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Decide on final location (emulator vs emulator.http package)
   - Complete migration of all endpoints
   - Standardize error handling

5. **Complete EmulatorServiceInitializer** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Ensure proper service initialization
   - Configure service dependencies
   - Implement service discovery

## Next Steps

1. Complete the EmulatorOperations rebuild to unblock other components
2. Finalize the EmulatorHttpHandler implementation
3. Complete the EmulatorServiceInitializer
4. Begin Phase 4: Migration of additional services
5. Update documentation to reflect the new architecture
